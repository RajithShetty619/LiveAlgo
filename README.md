Live Algorithm 

In today’s world navigating and travelling from one place to another 
using an app for directions has become the de facto and with various 
technologies and algorithms available, new developers can often get 
confused about which algorithm is the best one possible among all that 
are available.

This project will take starting, ending point with the prefered choice of 
algorithm & a maze for the grid(optional) as an input, process the algorithm based 
on its’ fundamental operating principles & methodology, then the grid will 
showcase the pattern on the screen via blocks of the grid being covered highlighting 
how the algorithm flows. In this project, we have presented the process of 
production and integration of software engineering & visualisation of various 
algorithms. This algorithm at its very primitive level will help users understand the 
flow of an algorithm much better & thus will help in the creation of an in-door 
navigational system
